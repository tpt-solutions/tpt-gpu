## Build Commands

```bash
cargo build --release -p tpt-gpu-script-cli
cargo build -p tpt-gpu-runtime
cd layer6_framework && pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## CLI Binary Name

The compiled binary is **`tpt-gpu-script`** (built with `cargo build -p tpt-gpu-script-cli`).
All tutorial command examples use `tpt` as a short alias — set it up once:

```bash
alias tpt=tpt-gpu-script          # bash / zsh
Set-Alias tpt tpt-gpu-script       # PowerShell
```

Or invoke the binary directly, e.g. `./target/release/tpt-gpu-script check file.tpts`.

## Common Operations

```bash
tpt check file.tpts
tpt compile file.tpts -o out/
tpt inspect matmul
tpt ops
python examples/basic_usage.py
```
